# Speech_Denoiser
Speech Denoiser by CMGAN.

- This repository is inspired from CMGAN. We cloned CMGAN from this source (CMGAN)[https://github.com/ruizhecao96/CMGAN)] and applied it for denoising some real speech audio. The model worked well in making the sound clearer, and we appeciate the contributions of CMGAN's authors.
- Because the original project is configured for training on GPU with multiple processers, this repository is modified in order to run on CPU and optional processors.
